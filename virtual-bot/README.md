# What's in version 2.10?

- User registration and login
- Logout feature
- Newly trained Arnold bot with more responses!
- Fixed Navbar to work on mobile
- Redirect to login page unless already logged in
- Hide scroll bar and implement auto scroll to chat window
- Update Home page graphics

Bugs:  
- No error message upon entering unsuccessful login credentials


Security Vulnerabilities:
- Access to chat space without logging in
- No spam filter to prevent spamming spam messages to bot

To do:
- Session management system to allow Dialogflow to detect unique sessions
- Unsecure connection (i.e.: no SSL connection)
- Protected routes to prevent access to specific links
- Performance optimizations
